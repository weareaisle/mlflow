`Model Evaluation <model-evaluation/index.html>`_
-------------------------------------------------

Dive into MLflow's robust framework for evaluating the performance of your ML models. 

With support for traditional ML evaluation (classification and regression tasks), as well as support for evaluating large language models (LLMs), 
this suite of APIs offers a simple but powerful automated approach to evaluating the quality of the model development work that you're doing.

In particular, for LLM evaluation, the `mlflow.evaluate()` API allows you to validate not only models, but providers and prompts. 
By leveraging your own datasets and using the provided default evaluation criteria for tasks such as text summarization and question answering, you can 
get reliable metrics that allow you to focus on improving the quality of your solution, rather than spending time writing scoring code.

Visual insights are also available through the MLflow UI, showcasing logged outputs, auto-generated plots, and model comparison artifacts. 



`Deep Learning <deep-learning/index.html>`_
-------------------------------------------

See how MLflow can help manage the full lifecycle of your Deep Learning projects. Whether you're using frameworks like 
**TensorFlow (tensorflow)**, **Keras (keras)**, **PyTorch (torch)**, **Fastai (fastai)**, or **spaCy (spacy)**, MLflow offers first-class support, 
ensuring seamless integration and deployment. Additionally, generic packaging frameworks that have native MLflow integration such as **ONNX (onnx)** 
grealy help to simplify the deployment of deep learning models to a wide variety of deployment providers and environments. 

Paired with MLflow's streamlined APIs and comparative UI, you are equipped with everything needed to manage, track, and optimize your deep learning workflows.



`Traditional ML <traditional-ml/index.html>`_
---------------------------------------------

Leverage the power of MLflow for all your Traditional Machine Learning needs. Whether you're working with supervised, unsupervised, statistical, or time series data, 
MLflow streamlines the process by providing an integrated environment that supports a large array of widely-used libraries like **Scikit-learn (sklearn)**, 
**SparkML (spark)**, **XGBoost (xgboost)**, **LightGBM (lightgbm)**, **CatBoost (catboost)**, **Statsmodels**, **Prophet**, and **Pmdarima**. 
With MLflow, you not only get APIs tailored for these libraries but also a user-friendly UI to compare various runs, ensuring that your model tuning and 
evaluation phases are both efficient and insightful.
