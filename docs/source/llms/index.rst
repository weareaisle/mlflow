LLMs
====

LLMs, or Large Language Models, have rapidly become a cornerstone in the machine learning domain, offering 
immense capabilities ranging from natural language understanding to code generation and more. 
However, harnessing the full potential of LLMs often involves intricate processes, from interfacing with 
multiple providers to fine-tuning specific models to achieve desired outcomes. 

Such complexities can easily become a bottleneck for developers and data scientists aiming to integrate LLM 
capabilities into their applications.

**MLflow's Support for LLMs** aims to alleviate these challenges by introducing a suite of features and tools designed with the end-user in mind:

`LLM Evaluation <llm-evaluate/index.html>`_
-------------------------------------------

.. toctree::

    llm-evaluate/index

Navigating the vast landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be daunting. Determining the right model, prompt, or service that aligns 
with a project's needs is no small feat. Traditional machine learning evaluation metrics often fall short when it comes to assessing the 
nuanced performance of generative models.

Enter `MLflow LLM Evaluation <llm-evaluate/index.html>`_. This feature is designed to simplify the evaluation process, 
offering a streamlined approach to compare foundational models, providers, and prompts.

Benefits of MLflow's LLM Evaluation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Simplified Evaluation**: Navigate the LLM space with ease, ensuring the best fit for your project with standard metrics that can be used to compare generated text.

- **Use-Case Specific Metrics**: Leverage MLflow's :py:func:`mlflow.evaluate` API for a high-level, frictionless evaluation experience.

- **Customizable Metrics**: Beyond the provided metrics, MLflow supports a plugin-style for custom scoring, enhancing the evaluation's flexibility.

- **Comparative Analysis**: Effortlessly compare foundational models, providers, and prompts to make informed decisions.

- **Deep Insights**: Dive into the intricacies of generative models with a comprehensive suite of LLM-relevant metrics.

MLflow's LLM Evaluation is designed to bridge the gap between traditional machine learning evaluation and the unique challenges posed by LLMs.


`Prompt Engineering UI <prompt-engineering/index.html>`_
--------------------------------------------------------

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1
    :hidden:

    prompt-engineering/index

Effective utilization of LLMs often hinges on crafting the right prompts. 
The development of a high-quality prompt is an iterative process of trial and error, where subsequent experimentation is not guaranteed to 
result in cumulative quality improvements. With the volume and speed of iteration through prompt experimentation, it can quickly become very 
overwhelming to remember or keep a history of the state of different prompts that were tried.

Serving as a powerful tool for prompt engineering, the `MLflow Prompt Engineering UI <prompt-engineering/index.html>`_ revolutionizes the 
way developers interact with and refine LLM prompts. 

Benefits of the MLflow Prompt Engineering UI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Iterative Development**: Streamlined process for trial and error without the overwhelming complexity.

- **UI-Based Prototyping**: Prototype, iterate, and refine prompts without diving deep into code.

- **Accessible Engineering**: Makes prompt engineering more user-friendly, speeding up experimentation.

- **Optimized Configurations**: Quickly hone in on the best model configurations for tasks like question answering or document summarization.

- **Transparent Tracking**: 

  - Every model iteration and configuration is meticulously tracked.
  - Ensures reproducibility and transparency in your development process.

.. note:: 
    The MLflow Prompt Engineering UI is in active development and has been marked as **Experimental**. 
    Features and interfaces may evolve as feedback is gathered and the tool is refined.
