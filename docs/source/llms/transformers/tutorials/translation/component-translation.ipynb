    "## Introduction to Translation with Transformers and MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we delve into the world of language translation by leveraging the power of [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers) and MLflow. This guide is crafted for practitioners with a grasp of machine learning concepts who seek to streamline their translation model workflows. We will showcase the use of MLflow to log, manage, and serve a cutting-edge translation model - the `google/flan-t5-base` from the [ü§ó Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Construct a translation **pipeline** using `flan-t5-base` from the Transformers library.\n",
    "- **Log** the translation model and its configurations using MLflow.\n",
    "- Determine the input and output **signature** of the translation model automatically.\n",
    "- **Retrieve** a logged translation model from MLflow for direct interaction.\n",
    "- Emulate the deployment of the translation model using MLflow's **pyfunc** model flavor for language translation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the conclusion of this tutorial, you'll gain a thorough insight into managing and deploying translation models with MLflow, thereby enhancing your machine learning operations for language processing.\n",
